In my quest to find a dead simple solution, I came across two other meta tag generators. This plugin takes the best of both plugins mentioned below and makes a dead simple plugin where web developers and designers can leave their company name / authorship info in the WEB_AUTHOR meta tag.

Head Meta Data - Head Meta Data adds a complete set of <meta> tags to the <head> section of all posts & pages.  - http://wordpress.org/plugins/head-meta-data/

Simple Meta Tags - Allows you to set global meta tags and customize on each individual page/post.  - http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-meta-tags/
